**Overall Description**    
For our first project for CPSC 581 (Human Computer Interaction II), we were asked to:  
Sketch, design, implement and document an application where the central interaction is with a button, such that when the user touches or clicks the button, some sort of responses or interactions happen.  

After many sketches and discussions, we decided to go with our psychological idea. We decided that a way to track how a parent spoils a child is a novel idea and acceptable for the project. To implement this we created a web application using Glitch, where a button was implemented to keep track of how many times it was clicked. The central interaction with this button surrounds the idea that whenever a parent wants to treat their child, they are encouraged to click on the button. This counter is used by our algorithm to determine if the parent is spoiling their child. Hidden to the user is an algorithm that will determine if the button is clicked too many times within a certain duration, if so then the application will advise the parent. Thus, the parent can treat their child in moderation. In a real-world situation we have demonstrated an ideal way to set this up with a box. The box contains items that a child would want, everytime the child opens the box, the edge of the box touches the button on our application.
